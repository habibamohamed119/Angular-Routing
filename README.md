<h1>Angular Routing Project<h1/>

 <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project is an Angular application that demonstrates the implementation of routing to create a single-page application (SPA).
Angular routing allows seamless navigation between different views/components without full-page reloads, providing a smooth user experience.</p>

 <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
Routes: Define routes in the application to map specific URLs to corresponding components.<br>
RouterOutlet: Placeholder where the routed component views are rendered.<br>
RouterModule: Module provided by Angular that provides routing functionality.<br>
Router: Service used to navigate between different routes programmatically.<br>
